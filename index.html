        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, there! My name is Riley!! I am majoring in Computer Science at
          Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah. My love for computer science
          dates back to 8th grade, when we had to do an hour of code assignment
          through Khan Academy. It was just very simple HTML programming, but I
          was hooked! I spent hours messing around with that assignment for fun.
          Shoutout to my teachers for making us do that, it altered the course
          of my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Aside from spending hours and hours in front of my computer for work
          and school, I have a few other hobbies. I love to spend time outside
          whenever possible, especially going hiking or swimming. I also really
          love to read and have read 21 books so far in 2023 (today's date is
          2/7). I also really enjoy traveling and seeing all of the beautiful
          places there are in the world!
